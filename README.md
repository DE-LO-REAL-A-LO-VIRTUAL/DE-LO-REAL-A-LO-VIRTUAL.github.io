    This work presents the development of an accessible and replicable methodology for the 
digitization of real-world objects through 3D scanning, with the aim of faithfully 
integrating them into virtual environments, particularly in the field of video games. Based 
on a hypothesis that proposes the technical and functional viability of this process, a 
three-phase approach has been established: theoretical research, practical 
development, and results analysis. As a case study, a 2015 Subaru WRX STI was scanned 
and virtualized, selected primarily for its geometric complexity, symbolic value, and 
applicability in simulators, among other factors evaluated using decision matrices. 
Following market research and an interview, the EINSTAR (SHINING 3D, 2022) device was 
selected for the scanning process. Various techniques, both existent and designed 
personally, were applied and designed to optimize both this process and the post
processing of the resulting mesh. The vehicle's implementation in the Assetto Corsa 
simulator (Kunos Simulazioni, 2014) served to validate the proposed methodology, 
assessing the scan’s fidelity, workflow efficiency, and user experience from the 
perspective of a novice in this sector of the industry.  
The result is a clear and practical methodology that allows industry developers and 
external entities to replicate the process for creative, educational, or social purposes. 
Thus, this work not only contributes technical value to the video game sector but also 
explores its potential as an accessible tool for simulation and design.
